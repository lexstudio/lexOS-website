            <h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started with lexOS</h3>
            <p>Welcome to the lexOS documentation. Here you will find all the information you need to get started with lexOS, including installation guides, user manuals, and troubleshooting tips.</p>

            <h3 id="installation-guide">Installation Guide</h3>
            <p>Follow these steps to install lexOS on your machine:</p>
            
            <p>0 Make a user named lex (on linux) and make it root (for more information why you need to do this read the github)</p>
            <p>1 Download lexium VM and lexOS-image</p>
            <p>2 Run lexium with normal settings (80% of your cpu will be used)</p>
            <p>3 For running lexOS run the RUNER executable</p>
            <p>4 The user will be lex and the password should be your user password and if that doesn't work try gulb12, i32, sun12, u32 or 1234</p>
                
            

            <h3 id="user-manual">User Manual</h3>
            <p>The lexOS user manual provides detailed information on how to use and customize your lexOS system.</p>

                <li><a href="#package-management">Package Management</a></li>
                <li><a href="#system-configuration">System Configuration</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h4 id="user-interface">User Interface</h4>
            <p>its a simple CLI interface and in that way will remain :)</p>

            <h4 id="Commands" </h4>
            <p>For commands type help in the OS</p>

            <h4 id="package-management">Package Management</h4>
            <p>we dont have but it has gcc vim and rustc (all of this are copies and then programed them to work on lexOS if you see any errors please go to lexOS-image issuse and report)</p>
            <h4 id="Errors">Troubleshooting</h4>
            <p>If you encounter any issues while using lexOS, report on lexOS-image github</p>

            <h4 id="system-configuration">System Configuration</h4>
            <p>system configuration will be big but in version 0.1 it only has a mini kernel editor but in the future i will add drivers editor a more complex kernel editor ,a CLi editor and a custom bare bone editor</p>
            <p>to run the minkernel editor go to the minkernel and run exec edit<p>

            <h4 id="Minkernel customization" </h4>
            <p>Lets go to the first customization<p>
            <p><p>
            <p>i or u<p>
            <p>Why would you chose i:<p>
            <p>1 i is used more in lexoterm which means that it will give a more flexible apps and interface for (in the next version of lexOS it will be switch to have more support for u for more information go to Progress report 0)<p>
            <p>2 because i is more faster than u that means that you will have more performance in your code and compile <p>
            <p>3 i is more functional <p>
            <p> The i is more fast and functional but the base of lexOS is made in u because its more stable and its more safer but i is a good option for slower cpu and it doesn't use much resources <p>
            
            <p>How i works:<p>
            <p>i comes from internal memory and its used in this kernel and interface like this i16 >> option.system()<p>

            <p>Why would you chose u :<p>

            <p>1 u is stable<p>
            <p>2 you have a feature that makes your pc handles better tasks<p>
            <p>3 the minkernel supports better u (in the next version of lexOS the support of i will be bigger)<p>
            <p>If you chose u lexOS will be more stable but in the futere the i and u are going to be more balanced<p>
            <p><p>
            <p><p>
            <p>For the next feature we have frenqency that isn't about the cpu frenqency but more of how much your pc can handle<p>
            <p>Because lexOS uses more cpu you will have to decide yourself if your cpu is good enough to run 64 32 or 16<p>
            <p>Some tips: if your cpu can run the 32 version but you want to be faster you could try the 16 version instead (same goes for the 64)<p>
            <p>If your cpu is good and can run 64 with easy (like the most cpu) and you want to be faster you should not run it at 32 it will slow your pc down<p>
            <p><p>
            <p><p>
            <p>BIT: just go with whatever your pc is 32bits or 64bits (even if you are on lexium virtual machine)<p>
            <p><p>
            <p><p>
            <p>For buffer size it depends on how much ram do you have (the lexium virual machine uses all of your ram if it needs).<p>
            <p>If you have 8GB or higher go with 8MB if you have below 8GB of ram go with 6MB (please do not go with the unlimited version it can breake your entier system)<p>
            <p><p>
            <p><p>
            <p>Drivers is your choice<p>
            <p><p>
            <p><p>
            <p>Cpu cores: 
          If you want to have a good experience use A normal usage but if you want to use lexOS in eco mode chose B liitel usage and BETA S zen it will run your cores at a much higher rate<p>
            <p><p>
            <p><p>
            <p>Cpu frenqency just go with normal<p>
            <p><p>
            <p><p>
            <p>CPU zen: Firs the zen tehnology runs a test on your cpu to see what are the fastest Cores in your cpu and it will run some programs using that cores<p>
            <p>zen mini use for testing and it will compile code faster and will run the system better</p>
            <p>zen normal use for testing and it will compile and run the system more on that cores</p>
            <p>BETA zen max use for running everything on that cores</p>
            <p><p>
            <p><p>
            <p>gfx (if you chose i please dont chose anything)<p>
            <p>If you have good ram and a good cpu you can run easily the u32 if you have bad ram and good cpu use u16 and if you have bad ram and bad cpu use u8</p>
            <p><p>
            <p><p>
            <p>i size (if you chose u please dont chose anything)<p>
            <p>if you have good memory and a good cpu use i16 and if you have anything else use i8<p>
            <p><p>
            <p><p>
            <p>C.. coming soon if you chose anything it will not work<p>
            <p><p>
