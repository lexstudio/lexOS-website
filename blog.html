          <h4>Subject</h4>
          <p>This week subject (9-15 2024) is the new text editor update</p>
          
          <h4>New interface</h4>
          <p>I made a new interface that looks much better than previous one</p>
          <p>I added a collor scheme and change the keyboard commands</p>
          <p>Keep in mind that the text editor is still in beta and it doesnt work that well in lexOS or linux changes can appear</p>
          <p>screenshoots</p>

          <p></p>
          <p></p>
          
          <h4>Low level problems</h4>
          <p>The text editor is still in beta the interface is working pretty well but in a low level it doesn't work that well</p>
          <p>some errors are that buffer memory initializer isn't giving enogh memory like if you open a bigger file it can crash or work very slow.</p>
          <img src="swappy-20240911_201631.png" alt="" style="width: auto; height: auto;">
          <p>another one is when kernel is called for saving or even run the app it can appear the error file isn't an executable , kernel kill process or even kernel cant run </p>
          <p>either of this error doesn't broke the system witch is eating my hour and days thinking why it doesnt really work. The way it needs to work is this:</p>
          <img src="swappy-20240911_211500.png" alt="" style="width: auto; height: auto;">
          <p>This error can be because the kernel caller isn't well made or that the handler for the functions that it gets isn't working properly</p>
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
          <h4>Progress</h4>
          <p>I can say that the new editor will be finished soon , probably nexxt week if i have time because the school has started :( but i will try to make as much free time to work on blogs and lexOS</p>
          <p>The interface is 100% ready but it could have some minor details that will be changed . In the low level part i will make it work even if i will edit the whole minkernel :).</p>
          <p>Yeah so if you dont like the interface i tried my best to make it looks good but this is what i can (even in neovim i use chadnvim not my own config )</p>
          <h4>Minkernel update coming soon</h4>
          <p>At moment i write this the minkernel 0.0.3 isn't finished its about 60% finished</p>
          <p>Minkernel 0.0.3 is coming soon with a better allocator a faster file manager and some added things to customizability</p>
          <p>And some more things is that the kernel is going to be upgraded to support better or to make lim work</p>
          <h4>Contact</h4>
          <p>For anything else i wait you in matrix/element in my server https://matrix.to/#/#lexos:matrix.org wait you there to have some tips for c go or rust for lowlevel or apps.I will even join sometimes in a voice group to chat and program in a team :)</p>
